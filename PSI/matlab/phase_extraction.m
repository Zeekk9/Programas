%% Function description
% *File Name*: phase_extraction.m
%%
% *Objective*: Phase extraction from the interferogram by following step:
% The FFT over the interferogram -> Shifting a positive side 
% peak on the frequency space to the center with removing other
% peaks.->Inverse FFT and phase extraction. [1]
%%
% *How to use 1*: _phase_extraction(data,mode)_ or
% _phase_extraction(data,mode,peak_width)_. Return: extracted phase in rad.
%%
% *How to use 2*: data is for interferogram image and mode is parameter determining operation mode.
% If the mode is set as 2, Automatic finding of side peak (containing phase shift information) in frequency space is done. (based on the condition 
% that number of of fringes is large enough so peaks in frequency space 
% are well separated) In this mode peak on top semicircle (in matrix 
% index order) of the frequency space except for left peak
% (for vertical fringe) is found. you can set side peak width
% in variable peak_width if default is not relevant for you.if the mode is set as other than 1, 
% peak is manually selected.
%%
% *List of user-defined parameters in function*: default_peak_width,
% separator (defines how much clean other peaks are cleared.)

F_angle = angle(Inv);  % The interferogram is represented as g(x,y) = a(x,y) + b(x,y)cos(2*pi*f_0*x + phi(x,y)) and the right (left) side peak is corresponding to phi (-phi). 
                         % But it should be noted that the sign of the actual phase phi is depending on the how the two beams are overlapped on the measurement plane.
